# OSNN_Model_Python
This repository contains a python implemetation of the OSNN Algorithm proposed by Soares et al. in their paper "OSNN: An online semisupervised neural network for nonstationary data streams". The objective of this project was to perform an analysis of supervised learning and semi-supervised learning for dealing with verification latency in the context of Just-in-Time Software Defect Prediction using the OSNN model.

# Introduction
OSNN is an online semisupervised neural network designed for data streams as the network trains on every incoming instance. It is a Radial Basis Function Neural Network, utilising centers to learn patterns and regions in unlabelled instances
